    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It is the building
        block of all websites, providing the structure and content of web pages. HTML consists of a series of elements,
        which are used to enclose different parts of the content to make it appear or behave in a certain way. For
        instance, elements can be used to create headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other content elements. HTML
        is not a programming language but a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML elements
        are represented by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing
        tag. For example, the paragraph tag is represented as
    <p> for the opening tag and </p> for the closing tag. Understanding HTML is essential for anyone looking to delve
    into web development, as it forms the foundation upon which all web content is built.

        HTML elements are the basic building blocks of HTML pages. They are represented by tags, which are used to
        define the different parts of the content. Each HTML element has an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. For
        example, a simple paragraph element is written as
        Some elements, known as self-closing elements, do not have a closing tag and include
        the content within a single tag. Examples of self-closing elements include for images and for line
        breaks. HTML elements can also have attributes, which provide additional information about the element.
        Attributes
        are included within the opening tag and are written as name-value pairs. For example, the src attribute in an
        tag specifies the path to the image file. Understanding the structure and
        syntax of HTML elements is crucial for creating well-formed and functional web pages.

        As you become more familiar with HTML, you'll encounter more advanced concepts and techniques that can enhance
        the functionality and appearance of your web pages. One such concept is the use of semantic HTML, which involves
        using HTML elements that convey the meaning of the content they enclose. Examples of semantic elements include
        and. Using semantic HTML improves the accessibility and search engine
        optimization (SEO) of your web pages. Another advanced concept is the integration of HTML with other
        web technologies, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. CSS is used to style the HTML
        content, controlling aspects like layout, colors, and fonts. JavaScript is a scripting language that
        adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. By combining HTML with CSS and JavaScript, you
        can create rich, interactive web experiences. As you continue to learn and practice HTML, you'll
        discover a wide range of tools and techniques that can help you build more sophisticated and
        engaging web pages.
